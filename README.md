# SetupEnv
Setups for different computer and VM environments that I use
Run the scripts in an elevated powershell session.

Before use ensure that you have set the executionpolicy to allow scripts

```ps1
Set-Executionpolicy unrestricted
```

Unblock the scripts for execution

```ps1
Get-ChildItem | Unblock-File
```
